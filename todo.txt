final:
- check for script support

low priority:
- commands
- validate draw data
- use binary transport for draw data

bugs:
- draw drag off canvas
- idle -> finishes round
- resolution of drawing is poor
- bandwidth
- text wrapping on users and text
- say who last artist was
- xhr poll error
- prevent unicode spam
- limit number of chat lines
- shuffle words better
- afk users that guess words are hard to see
- sound for every guess
- send guessed word to artists
- chat length not limited
- spam possible
- ping
- don't send back drawn
- drawing corners

wip:
- clear should clear drawing log
